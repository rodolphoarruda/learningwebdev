from the command line, trying to access a web server is as simple as this:

`telnet rodolphoarruda.pro.br 80` for the TCP port 80.

result will be

`Trying 172.67.169.142...
Connected to rodolphoarruda.pro.br.
Escape character is '^]'.`

if we type then

`get / HTTP/1.1`

we get a response from the web server.

`
