# CSS

Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a *style sheet language*. 

CSS is what you use to selectively *style HTML elements*.

## Linking to an external stylesheet

Add a link element to the <head> area of the HTML page. Like this one:

`<link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`

## Structure of declarations.

Let's see this example. This is a CSS "declaration" for the paragraph element.

`
p {
  color: red;
}
`

The letter "p" is the selector. It defines the html element to be styled.

"color" is a property of the selector.

"red" is the value of that property.

What is between curly brackets is a declaration. A declaration is a single style rule and not a set of rules. A declaration ends with a semi-colon.

This is an element with multiple declarations, which makes it a "ruleset".
`
p {
  color: red;
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
`

It is possible to apply the same property to multiple selectors at once using commas to separate each element. Example below.

`
li,
h1 {
  color: red;
}
`

## Types of selectors

There are a lot of types of selectors. Here are the most common for beginners.

The first one is the "tag selector", like "p" for the <p> tag.

Then there is the "ID selector", which can be created and whose value must be unique within the page. It cannot be used to style a paragraph and an image at the same page, for instance. ID selectors use the hash sign #. So, as a rule of thumb, ID means individuality. 

"#my-id"
selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id"> 

Class selectors are named having a dot as a suffix. It can be used several times within a page to style various elements at the same time. As a rule of thumb, a class is a class of things, collective.

".my-class"
selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class">

Attribute selector works on the attribute of an element, but does not effect the element itself. For example:

"img[src]"
selects <img src="myimage.png">

Pseudo-class selectors work only on a specific state. For example.

"a:hover"
selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link. 

## Comments

Anything in CSS between /* and */ is a CSS comment.

## The "box model"

CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Boxes pilled up on other boxes.

Property with 4 possible values like "padding" or "margin" are interpreted clockwise.

`padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;`

Will be interpreted as

padding: top right bottom left;
